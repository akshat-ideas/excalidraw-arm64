## Self-hosting on ARM (Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon)

This fork tracks [excalidraw/excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) and adds what is needed to build and run the Excalidraw client on ARM hosts such as a Raspberry Pi 5 or an Apple Silicon Mac. The application source is unchanged.

### Requirements

- A 64-bit OS. `uname -m` should print `aarch64` or `arm64`.
- Docker 23 or newer. The `Dockerfile` needs BuildKit, which is the default from Docker 23 on. On older versions, prefix the build command with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`.
- About 4 GB of free memory for the build. In testing it was killed at 3 GB and succeeded at 4 GB. An 8 GB Raspberry Pi 5 or any Apple Silicon Mac is fine. On a 4 GB board add swap first, and on a 2 GB board [build on another machine](#build-on-another-machine). Running the finished image needs very little memory.

### Build and run

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/akshat-ideas/excalidraw-arm64.git
cd excalidraw-arm64
docker build -t excalidraw-arm64 .
docker run -d --name excalidraw --restart unless-stopped -p 3000:80 excalidraw-arm64
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`, or `http://<host-ip>:3000` from another machine. To use a different port, change the first number in `-p 3000:80`. The container starts again by itself after a reboot.

### Update

Sync the fork with upstream on GitHub first, then:

```bash
git pull
docker build -t excalidraw-arm64 .
docker rm -f excalidraw
docker run -d --name excalidraw --restart unless-stopped -p 3000:80 excalidraw-arm64
```

Drawings are saved in the browser, not in the container, so replacing the container does not remove them.

### Build on another machine

Use this when the target has too little memory to build, or runs a 32-bit OS (the Node.js build image has no 32-bit ARM variant). On any machine with Docker:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t excalidraw-arm64 --load .
docker save excalidraw-arm64 | gzip > excalidraw-arm64.tar.gz
```

For a 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS use `--platform linux/arm/v7` instead. Copy the file to the target, then:

```bash
docker load -i excalidraw-arm64.tar.gz
docker run -d --name excalidraw --restart unless-stopped -p 3000:80 excalidraw-arm64
```

### Prebuilt image

The [Publish Docker (GHCR)](.github/workflows/publish-ghcr.yml) workflow builds the image for `amd64`, `arm64` and `arm/v7` and pushes it to `ghcr.io/akshat-ideas/excalidraw-arm64` on every push to `master`. GitHub keeps workflows disabled on a fork until they are enabled in the repository's Actions tab. Once the workflow has run:

```bash
docker run -d --name excalidraw --restart unless-stopped -p 3000:80 ghcr.io/akshat-ideas/excalidraw-arm64:latest
```

### Limitations

The image contains only the client. Shareable links and live collaboration still use the services hosted by Excalidraw, as configured in `.env.production`.

## Features

The Excalidraw editor (npm package) supports:

- 💯&nbsp;Free & open-source.
- 🎨&nbsp;Infinite, canvas-based whiteboard.
- ✍️&nbsp;Hand-drawn like style.
- 🌓&nbsp;Dark mode.
- 🏗️&nbsp;Customizable.
- 📷&nbsp;Image support.
- 😀&nbsp;Shape libraries support.
- 🌐&nbsp;Localization (i18n) support.
- 🖼️&nbsp;Export to PNG, SVG & clipboard.
- 💾&nbsp;Open format - export drawings as an `.excalidraw` json file.
- ⚒️&nbsp;Wide range of tools - rectangle, circle, diamond, arrow, line, free-draw, eraser...
- ➡️&nbsp;Arrow-binding & labeled arrows.
- 🔙&nbsp;Undo / Redo.
- 🔍&nbsp;Zoom and panning support.

## Excalidraw.com

The app hosted at [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) is a minimal showcase of what you can build with Excalidraw. Its [source code](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/tree/master/excalidraw-app) is part of this repository as well, and the app features:

- 📡&nbsp;PWA support (works offline).
- 🤼&nbsp;Real-time collaboration.
- 🔒&nbsp;End-to-end encryption.
- 💾&nbsp;Local-first support (autosaves to the browser).
- 🔗&nbsp;Shareable links (export to a readonly link you can share with others).

We'll be adding these features as drop-in plugins for the npm package in the future.

## Quick start

**Note:** following instructions are for installing the Excalidraw [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@excalidraw/excalidraw) when integrating Excalidraw into your own app. To run the repository locally for development, please refer to our [Development Guide](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/introduction/development).

Use `npm` or `yarn` to install the package.

```bash
npm install react react-dom @excalidraw/excalidraw
# or
yarn add react react-dom @excalidraw/excalidraw
```
